1. Overview:
The Expense Tracker is a full-stack web application that allows users to record and review personal expenses. Users can add expenses with amount, category, description, and date, and filter or sort them to analyze spending patterns.

2. Architecture:

Frontend: React (Vite)

Backend: REST API (FastAPI / Express / any backend)

Persistence: SQLite / JSON / any lightweight DB

Communication: Frontend calls backend API via HTTP (JSON)

+------------+       HTTP/JSON       +-------------+       Persistence
| Frontend   | <----------------->   | Backend API | <-----------------+
| React/Vite |                       | FastAPI     |                   |
+------------+                       +-------------+                   |
                                                                     SQLite/JSON
3. Components:

Component	
Expense Form- Add new expenses (amount, category, description, date)
Expense Table- Display list of expenses with sorting and filtering
Filter & Sort Controls- Filter by category, sort by newest
Total Display- Show total of visible expenses
API Layer- Handles GET and POST requests to backend
Error/Loading State	Display errors and loading indicators

4. User Stories Covered:

Create expense entries

View all expenses

Filter by category (case-insensitive ideal)

Sort by newest

Show total of filtered/visible expenses

5. Non-functional Considerations:

Idempotency for POST requests to handle retries

Validation: required fields, no future dates, no negative amounts (optional)

Resilient to network issues (loading, error handling)

Simple UI for clarity and usability
